# Fluid Troll Bridge
A simple Unity example that takes advantage of the planning capabilities of the [Fluid Hierarchical Task Network](https://github.com/ptrefall/fluid-hierarchical-task-network) planner.

## Disclaimer
Big thank you to [SythianCat](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/21747) and [Dungeon Mason](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/23554) for allowing me to use their assets in the development of this example.

## About
The example sets up a scenario where a troll patrols two bridges and humans are nearby. The focus of the example is to show how useful it can be to customize the domain builder, effects, conditions and operators to the particular needs of a game. We also strive to set up a decent framework around the agents, with modular sensors and monster-agnostic APIs that all the agents in the game can share most, if not all, of the AI features we customize for it.

This is just a simple example that show 'a' way to use the planner.

This example will improve over time.
